### Description of the Project: 

The Project Team Generator is a command line application that prompts the user for information about the team manager, engineers, and interns. The generator will create HTML files that display a team roster based on the information provided by the user.

### Installation instructions: 

Once the file app.js is opened, install the Inquirer npm package by entering npm install inquirer –save at the command prompt. The application is ready for use.

### Usage instructions: 

To begin the application, enter node app.js at the command prompt. This will ask the user to answer questions at the command prompt about each team member. The questions for each team member include, “What is your name,” “What is your role,” “What is your ID number,” and “What is your email?” Additional questions include, for the Manager; “What is your office number;” for the Engineers; “What is your Git Hub username,” and for the Interns; “What school did you attend?” Once the questions are answered, the application will generate a roster for the entire team on the main.html file and rosters for the manager, engineers and interns on the manager.html, engineer.html and itern.html files.
